      I’m currently an Engineer at <a class="underline-link" href="https://iterable.com" target="_blank">Iterable</a>, building out their mobile SDK with their fabulous tech-savvy team! I recently graduated from <a class="underline-link" href="https://cci.uncc.edu/" target="_blank">UNCC</a> with a Master’s Degree in Computer Science after an outstanding three months of internship at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.imaginovation.net/" target="_blank">Imaginovation LLC</a> and after publishing my thesis work on How Mixed Reality can be helpful in emergency situations like fire hazards which you can find 👉 <a class="underline-link" href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/58073d98761892bebd92a057ee542069/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank">here</a>. I did my first Code Push in 2014 at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.atos-syntel.net" target="_blank">Syntel Atos</a>, the very first company I worked for after my bachelors where my brain discovered a world full of ideas, APIs and a future in mobile space.

      Building beautiful apps which follows the design guidelines in all its aspects to increase its practicality and usability is something that I strive for every time. My favorite part of software engineering is the Synergy which results from great team work. Its where the knowledge grows, ideas combine, different perspectives are considered and decisions are finalized. I enjoy designing prototypes like <a class="underline-link" href ="https://www.figma.com/file/LNPXr52vQcjTL70MMcHkZ4uh/UNCC-YesPlusAppIdea?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">this one</a> for mobile apps and speculate a bright future in app continuity taking place between different form factors and perhaps across different OS.

      I also tend to unwind from a world of electricity and internet 😁. A sound sleep under a soft blanket, meeting and spending time with my friends and family members, running, driving cars and bike, playing my guitar and singing with it are few moments I enjoy reliving again and again.
